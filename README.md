# Random Quote Machine

One of the final project's for the [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) 
Front-End development libraries course. It was written in WebStorm using the React.js framework. It features loading in
objects from an external JSON file (quotes and their author's), to be displayed at random whenever the page loads or the
"New Quote" button is pressed.

It also has the ability to share a specific quote to Twitter. I had the intent on making it sharable on facebook but it 
seems facebook requires the page to be online before I'm able to introduce that functionality. It will be something I'll
be looking into once I sort out GitHub Pages.
